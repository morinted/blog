Hello, my name is Ted Morin, and today I'm going to give you an introduction to stenography and show you what it looks like to write on a steno machine.

Stenography is the art of shorthand, it's a skill that lets you write out in longhand (meaning: fully spelled out words and sentences) while saving lots of energy with a simpler, "shorter" system. The reduction in movement and complexity of language into shorthand means that stenographers can keep up with someone speaking, which is necessary in a courtroom setting where every word is to be recorded for the purpose of law and there are often multiple speakers, sometimes speaking over each other.

Inevitably, when I mention a stenographer, people bring up speech recognition. As a software developer, I can say that speech recognition is a very interesting application of technology and a fascinating field of study, but at the moment it cannot beat a stenographer with a steno machine. Think of Apple's Siri; while really cool and sometimes useful, Siri often has trouble understanding just one person talking clearly into a microphone, whereas a stenographer can understand multiple speakers talking over each other, even with heavy accents and mumbling.

With that out of the way, I'd like to mention that stenography isn't just for court reporters. I'm a software developer and I use stenography to program. Journalists can use stenography to write more quickly and comfortably than is possible on a normal keyboard. Some people just want to be fast on TypeRacer. Whatever your *reason*, stenography is a great hobby to pick up and is becoming easier to get into every day.

The purpose of this article is to give you a demo of the steno machine. On this sample steno machine, I've attached labels to show what each key is. However, you will probably never see a stenographer writing on a machine with labels, they are simply not useful because they lose meaning quickly as you start to learn the system better. However, they will let me communicate to you as someone who, I am assuming, has never studied stenography.

There are a couple things to notice on the layout. First, there are very few keys. This is because language is actually pretty simple phonetically compared to spelling, and the steno machine is a phonetic input system. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, but not 26 sounds, as you have duplicates like the threesome S, K, and C. C is redundant because you can express "ssss" with an S and a kah with a K. Next, you'll notice that across the two sides, there are duplicate keys. This is because the layout is actually used to produce syllables, which have a start and an end. The left hand is the start and the right is the end. In the middle, it naturally follows that we have vowels.

Finally, there are lots of missing keys. Notice there is no N key, not at the beginning nor at the end of the syllable. This is actually based on statistics: only common sounds are part of the base layout. The rarer the sound, the more keys you need to press to get to it. I'll explain this in a moment. First, let's see what it's like to write your first words on a steno machine.

As I said before, we are in the business of creating syllables, and you do that by hitting all the keys on the steno machine at the same time and then releasing them together. Let's write our first word, how about the first one that pops into our head: POP, pop! Let's see it again. Pop. Notice that nothing happens until I release the keys. You can press them in any order. Pop, the order still reads left to right, you can't change this. Pop pop pop pop. Next, let's add some more keys. POPS → now the word will be plural, pops pops pops. We can add more keys on the left, too. Let's add in the left R, props. Props props props. We are writing a 5 letter word in almost an instant with this chord.

We can do even better, at this point we are still writing literally, one key per letter. However, stenography is all about speed, and so we shorten very common words into what are called briefs. Briefs usually make sense in that there are hints as to how to use them, but they don't read out in syllable form exactly like "props" does. For example, the most common word in the English language is "the", and so we give it its own key, the right-hand T: the. That's all it takes, one key, when used alone, gives a whole word. There are many common words that you can do with just one key alone on the default layout: left S outputs "is", left T is "it", the K makes can. Pressing the U key makes the word "you". You probably already use some basic form of shorthand while texting, where you might use "ur" instead of "you're" and guess what, that's exactly what we use in steno, yet the output is full longhand: UR—you're. Maybe you've had a professor in a class that would use the shorthand "w" to replace the common word "with". That's also a brief out of the box with stenography: with.

Now, you might be wondering, how do you make the missing sounds. I should say now that in addition to there being an order, from left to right for the entire board, there is also an order for every single key, which moves in a pattern from top to bottom, left to right, STKPWHRAOEUFRPBLGTSDZ. This order never changes and can be used to make any word in the English language, with some tricks when you encounter an uncommon phonetic pattern.

Let's look at a missing letter: N. There are syllables that have two Ns, like "none", as in "none of that". The designer of the English steno machine way back in the 1910s, Ward Stone Ireland, made sure that common sounds were well represented in the base layout. The hidden sounds are given by pairing letters that ideally don't cause a conflict. For example, the left N is given by TPH. The reason for this is, phonetically, nothing starts with TPH. On the right side, the -PB keys are used to represent N. Words in English don't end in -PB. For my example, none, we hit "TPHOPB", or more simply, "NON", which makes "none". There's no conflict with real English with these chords, for example, to say this chord out loud would be "tiphopb", which I can certainly say is *not* English by any stretch of the imagination.

Now, this is the basis that makes up steno theory. You have the base keys and chords for missing sounds, and with this you can write pretty much the entire English language. There exist different theories and layouts, generally for each language. English stenography is the easiest to learn at the moment, though, because there are lots of resources for it online.

I'd like to show you a couple more sample strokes on the steno machine, but I won't explain them all as clearly as I did previously. This is more of my way to show off to you the power of stenography, as you learn to take advantage of the theory and bring it to new places. Let's look at some briefs that turn long, common words into very, very short strokes:

- `X-M`: Example
- `T-N`: Continue
- `K-R`: Consider
- `K-RGS`: Consideration
- `KPEGS`: Competition
- `PLARL`: Particularly
- `XRAOEM`: Extremely
- `OFB`: Obviously
- `YOEN`: I don't know
- `FIFS`: If I was
- `FURM`: If you remember
- `LAJ`: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
- `SFRAJ`: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
- `STRAURLS`: All work and no play makes Teddy a dull boy.
- `LA*N/FA*IR`: Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
- `KW*IX`: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Some of these are common briefs, some of them clearly party tricks, but after learning stenography, writing English honestly feels like a party trick.

If you are curious about learning steno, I encourage you to join our community. It is great and very open to newcomers over at http://opensteno.org, check out the discuss link at the top of the page to join the Plover Discord chat server, where there are learners and stenographers alike ready to answer your questions and geek out on cool keyboard talk. Getting started with learning stenography can be quite cheap, as Plover, the software that understands my chords and turns them into words, is free. You can try out stenography on a regular keyboard, and then once you are ready you can upgrade to something like this machine that I'm writing on, for about $200. Professional stenographers will generally use very specialized machines and software, each of which cost thousands of dollars, but you don't need to spend this to learn how to use stenography. I hope this video was interesting, if you have any ideas or want to learn more, give a thumbs up to the video and post a comment with your suggestions. I'm always open to chat about steno and will consider making more videos if you have a particular steno-related subject you'd like to know more about.
