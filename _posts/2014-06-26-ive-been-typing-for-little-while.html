I've been typing for a little while.<br /><br />I imagine that most people have been typing for a little while.<br /><br />Born in 1994, I didn't regularly use a computer until the age of 11. I'd say that my behavior on the keyboard was not completely typical, compared to others my age. I noticed that in order to be listened to on forums, I had to type properly, using full words and capital letters. If I ever used lazy forms such as "u r" and "l8 bro gtg", then it mustn't have been for long. I instead opted to take a large speed hit so that I could type properly.<br /><br />Of course, I wasn't perfect. My grammar and spelling were imperfect, as they are now. Well, maybe I've improved a little. My speed went up rather quickly. People on MSN often asked me why I added periods to the end of my messages. They didn't quite get it. To be honest, though, I didn't quite get it. It just felt <i>good</i>.<br /><br />I remember getting my first mobile phone, an LG touchscreen phone with a slide-out keyboard. Again, all text messages had full words and proper punctuation. It was an odd obsession of mine.<br /><br />One day, I was looking at the Das Keyboard online, and the blank keycaps really appealed to me on an aesthetic level, though I didn't quite touch type. I decided that I should remove the lettering from my Dell keyboard. I Google'd around on how to remove lettering, and decided that I didn't really have the resources necessary to properly make my keys blank, so I just grabbed some sandpaper and brought the keyboard to school. On lunch breaks for a few days, I just sat in a corner, removing keys, sanding their lettering, and placing them back on the board. I noticed difficulty in keyboard shortcuts, like Ctrl+J for downloads in Firefox. The awkwardness lasted less than a week after sanding the board, at which point I could finally touch type comfortably and hit most shortcuts without counting keys.<br /><br />Oh, I had decided to memorize the QWERTY layout, and to do that I filled dozens of pages in my French-Religion class textbook with the layout, in varying sizes. I still sometimes dictate it when bored:<br /><br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =<br />! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ +<br />qwertyuiop<br />asdfghjkl;'<br />zxcvbnm,./<br />Ctrl, Win, Alt, Space, Alt, Context Menu, Ctrl<br /><br />Altogether, I was happy with everything. I had my make-shift blank keyboard with unevenly sanded keys, and I could touch-type the QWERTY layout at about 95WPM. See this chart of about 70 races from TypeRacer at the time:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4AksJWFsO2w/U6yXV2uX50I/AAAAAAAAGe4/t3d8L99hoFs/s1600/qwerty.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4AksJWFsO2w/U6yXV2uX50I/AAAAAAAAGe4/t3d8L99hoFs/s1600/qwerty.png" alt="alt="TypeRacer Qwerty stats showing my speed hovering around 95WPM" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />One day I was reading an <a href="http://xkcd.com/554/">XKCD Comic</a>&nbsp;where the&nbsp;Dvorak keyboard layout is mentioned. After some research, I decided that Dvorak sounded really nice. I can't find the site I used to learn Dvorak, it may have gone down. I also remember the <a href="http://www.dvzine.org/">DVZine </a>being a great inspiration to switch.<br /><br />Learning the keyboard took a while, about a week to learn the layout, and longer to become at all proficient in typing it. I also had a pretty nice indication of progress on TypeRacer, which I started using after hitting about the 25WPM point with Dvorak.<br /><br />I really did love Dvorak. This is evident as I used it exclusively for about two years. See my over 2500 TypeRacer races showing my progress:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVvAXR74agY/U6ygWYR-p0I/AAAAAAAAGf0/Yr4UTaNHw7U/s1600/dvorak.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVvAXR74agY/U6ygWYR-p0I/AAAAAAAAGf0/Yr4UTaNHw7U/s1600/dvorak.png" alt="2000 races with constant but slow progress to over 100WPM" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Dvorak did a lot of things right, making it a much more comfortable layout than Qwerty. That being said, the speed difference wasn't great compared to Qwerty, but the comfort and accuracy were. I could type Dvorak for hours on end without any discomfort, with high accuracy. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I never "properly" typed on the Qwerty layout. I tended to hold my right hand one column to the right, so that my pinky always rested on the shift key. Being left-handed, my left-hand didn't mind the extra responsibility.<br /><br />Notice a dip in the chart, around the 500 race mark. This marked the purchase of my first ergonomic keyboard, the TypeMatrix 2030:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h4ywvuseDzQ/U6yTt3LgAdI/AAAAAAAAGeU/6pVb38ZLbHQ/s1600/2030usb_us_dvorak_703x289.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="262" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h4ywvuseDzQ/U6yTt3LgAdI/AAAAAAAAGeU/6pVb38ZLbHQ/s1600/2030usb_us_dvorak_703x289.png" alt="TypeMatrix with Dvorak layout" width="640" /></a></div><br />It had Dvorak markings, which I proudly displayed and used to confuse my high-school friends. I actually bothered to bring the keyboard to school.<br /><br />As I said, I typed Dvorak for around 2 years. It never did me wrong, and a lot of its problems, like Ctrl+Q,Z,C,V, and B being inconvenient, didn't really bother me. Luckily the TypeMatrix helped ease the shortcut issues, namely by offering cut, copy, and paste as function keys.<br /><br />Then I met Colemak. I read about its various supposed improvements over Dvorak, boasting its similarity to Qwerty. I was beginning to get frustrated with the Dvorak layout, especially as I was becoming more active in programming.<br /><br />I decided, then, to abandon Dvorak, to switch to Colemak. People recommended Colemak over Dvorak all over the web. "It's more modern", "Computer-aided as opposed to book-written", etc. I felt obligated to switch. I managed to learn the Colemak layout a lot quicker than Dvorak, in only 3 or 4 days, as opposed to a full week. That being said, in my year and half with Colemak, I never quite experienced the same thrills that I had with Dvorak. Notice my less-than-enthusiastic participation on TypeRacer with this layout:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VnIl_mVDwns/U6yXV15MGuI/AAAAAAAAGfI/bGWpYujFIQg/s1600/colemak.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VnIl_mVDwns/U6yXV15MGuI/AAAAAAAAGfI/bGWpYujFIQg/s1600/colemak.png" alt="Unimpressive progression with fewer races than Dvorak, speed similar to QWERTY at 95WPM" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />I stopped playing on TypeRacer after only 207 races. Rest assured that my speed did continue to increase, until I hit my Qwerty-equivalent 95WPM average.<br /><br />I had one major gripe with Colemak, though: lateral finger movement. Basically, on Colemak, they put D and H on the home row. These letters are not uncommon, and using them requires lateral finger movement, which I tend to dislike. I especially hated H's position, as H is used in combination with many other letters. I like rolling, but found that to be a particularly painful flaw for my style of typing. This brought me to learn about <a href="http://www.workmanlayout.com/blog/">Workman</a>. Workman seemed to address the issues I had with Colemak, and so I instantly decided to give it a try. Much to my disappointment, though, I found typing to be an unpleasant experience. Something about the layout felt "off" to my hands, and I can't quite describe it. Obviously the feeling is subjective, but by the time I hit 30WPM, I didn't want to type in Workman anymore:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z0h4cgqybRA/U6yWvUnglpI/AAAAAAAAGes/K--Y2fpRs-M/s1600/workman.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z0h4cgqybRA/U6yWvUnglpI/AAAAAAAAGes/K--Y2fpRs-M/s1600/workman.png" width="640" alt="Only a couple races and a very sad jagged line" /></a></div><br />So don't worry, we're only due for one more switch. Paying attention to the download page for the Workman layout, I noticed that it was hosted by David Norman, inventor of the <a href="https://normanlayout.info/">Norman layout</a>. Norman saw flaws in the Workman layout and so made his own using similar principles. To me, it really seemed to hit all the points I was worrying about.<br /><br />Similarity to Qwerty, for the sake of keyboard shortcuts (and learning, but I personally don't care about this), H on the homerow (at the time of learning, H and R were switched, but the middle finger is still very convenient to go up a row), minimized lateral finger movement, and a love for testing and statistics.<br /><br />Norman was the quickest-learnt layout. It only took me a couple hours to memorize the layout, a couple days to reach TypeRacer-appropriate speeds. Since that week, I've been typing Norman, again almost 2 years now. It's by far the most enjoyable keyboard layout I've used, similar to Dvorak in terms of how much I enjoy it. You can see my speed on TypeRacer here:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8ifHiiLJWrU/U6yY1kgwKnI/AAAAAAAAGfQ/-tgN_Lt7MN8/s1600/norman.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8ifHiiLJWrU/U6yY1kgwKnI/AAAAAAAAGfQ/-tgN_Lt7MN8/s1600/norman.png" alt="Norman races going up over 100 like Dvorak" width="640" /></a></div><br />Notice a dip around the 900 race mark. It was at this point that I decided to focus more on accuracy, and also around the time that I received my second ergonomic keyboard, the <a href="http://ergodox.org/">ErgoDox</a>.<br /><br />The ErgoDox meant a big change, moving away from my trusted TypeMatrix. It features advantages, such as being mechanical, programmable, and split. Not to mention it also has two thumb-islands with 6 keys apiece.<br /><br />My ErgoDox has Cherry MX Clear switches, and is obviously programmed to type in the Norman keyboard layout. I find the combination very comfortable. I have used the thumb-keys to reduce my pinky usage, thus reducing fatigue.<br /><br />I also now type at an average of 100WPM, which is slightly higher than my original Qwerty speed, all those years ago. I can still type Qwerty, of course, but Norman provides accuracy and comfort that Qwerty just can't match.<br /><br />Here are some pictures of the ErgoDox:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DkoPlGmNS8U/U6yaQhll5mI/AAAAAAAAGfk/ccY30Q4AsK8/s1600/01+-+This+is+my+first+mechanical+keyboard+an+ErgoDox+with+Cherry+MX+Clears.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DkoPlGmNS8U/U6yaQhll5mI/AAAAAAAAGfk/ccY30Q4AsK8/s1600/01+-+This+is+my+first+mechanical+keyboard+an+ErgoDox+with+Cherry+MX+Clears.jpg" alt="ErgoDox, split mechanical keyboard" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qEUxSqglyy0/U6yaQS6gxgI/AAAAAAAAGfc/e6ofOu6lqAQ/s1600/06+-+My+UX301LA-XH72T+has+a+thin+lid.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qEUxSqglyy0/U6yaQS6gxgI/AAAAAAAAGfc/e6ofOu6lqAQ/s1600/06+-+My+UX301LA-XH72T+has+a+thin+lid.jpg" alt="Ultrabook with keyboard resting on sides, split" width="320" /></a></div>You can see more pictures on <a href="http://imgur.com/a/BD2Fj">this Imgur album</a>.<br /><br />All this to say: I very much enjoy typing. I find myself typing every day as I'm actively programming, emailing, and redditing. Typing is exciting, and I think that far too many people overlook one of the most frequent tasks in their daily lives.<br /><br />Get a good keyboard. Consider a new layout. It doesn't take <i>that</i>&nbsp;much time or tech-savvy. I'd say about 2 weeks of losses, and 1-3 months of improvements to reach your previous level, as long as you are serious about the switch.<br /><br />This brings me to why I've started this blog. Recently, I reprogrammed my ErgoDox from the Massdrop Configurator's default firmware to the TMK Firmware, which introduced a lot of cool features. I've also started learning Vim bindings and looking at Plover, an open-source stenography program.<br /><br />I'll share my more recent experiences with keyboarding and text input in future posts.
