  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Ted. I'm a software engineering graduate from the University of Ottawa.
    My day job is working as a React/Redux frontend dev at
    <a href="https://www.clearwaterclinical.com/">Clearwater Clinical</a>. In the night I work with
    friends around the world to lead and maintain the
    <a href="http://opensteno.org">Open Steno Project</a> and
    <a href="https://opensteno.org/plover">Plover</a>. Please note that my opinions expressed here
    are my own and don't represent necessarily those of Clearwater, Open Steno, or even my current
    self (damn you, past self!)
